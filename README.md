# ANWI - All New Wireless IDS (ESP32 Port)

ANWI is a new type of Wireless Intrusion Detection System which is based on a low cost Wi-Fi module (ESP32) and can be deployed at the physical perimeter of the coverage area. It allows organizations that cannot afford expensive WIDS solutions to protect their networks at a fraction of the cost.

**Note:** This is a port of the original [ANWI](https://github.com/SanketKarpe/anwi) project (originally for ESP8266) to the ESP32 platform.
